                            <li>Chameleons change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.</li>
                            <li>They can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees. This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to!</li>
                            <li>59 unique species of chameleon live on the island of Madagascar and are found nowhere else. This is over a quarter of the world’s 202 species.</li>

                            <li>Some species of Asiatic bear build nests in the trees. They can use these for hiding, eating and even sleeping.</li>

                            <li>Giant pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, mainly on bamboo.</li>
                            <li>Although pandas are 99% vegetarian their digestive system is typical of a carnivore. For the 1% of their diet that isn't bamboo, pandas eat eggs, small animals, carrion, and forage in farmland for pumpkin, kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food. </li>
                            <li>Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up. </li>

                            <li>These desert animals can survive for 6-7 months without water. Nonetheless, whenever they access to water they can drink as much as 32 gallons in one drinking session!</li>
                            <li>Camels can run as fast as 65 kilometers per hour and sustain a walking speed of 40 kilometers per hour. </li>
                            <li>Camels have a thick layer of skin which makes it possible for them to sit on the hot sand without being burned.</li>
